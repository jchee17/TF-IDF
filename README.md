# TF-IDF
Information Retrieval search by cosine-distance ranking of document vector 
representations. 
The document vector representations are based on the
term frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) score, per word,
per document.

Given a scientific paper, determine the most relevant wikipedia articles.
The scientific paper is the 'query', the returned ranked wikipedia aritlces
are the search results. 
The purpose of this project was to determine the feasibility of applying
topic modeling by LDA. 
This information retrieval search can be viewed as a rudimentary topic 
decomposition of the statistics papers, by statistical and mathematical
wikipedia articles.
This project is a step towards the Hopper Project's overall goal of
developing statistical machine learning algorithms for extracting 
representations of text and mathematical expressions and building new 
search tools for the published scientific literature
